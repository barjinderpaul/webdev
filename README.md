# Web Development
This repository contains the code done during learning web development. <br />
The README.md contains brief notes about the topics which I learned.

# HTML

#### `<meta>` tag
> `<meta charset="utf-8">` 

meta tag is used to give info about page without reading the body.
But as of now search engines read contents of pages; 
`<meta name="keyword"/>`
"utf-8" => set of characters used to type the document, always should be the first line

>`<meta name="viewport" content="width=devide-width, initial-scale=1">`

Always displays websited as scaled according to the device's width and 
only scaled to 1, such that there are no horizontal scroll bars.


#### Typing Symbols
>`4&gt;3  3&lt;4 &quot;hey, you seeing it&quot; 
&amp; all of it is under &copy; &copysr;`

4&gt;3  3&lt;4 &quot;hey, you seeing it&quot; 
&amp; all of it is under &copy; &copysr;
